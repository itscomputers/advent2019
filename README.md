# Advent2019

My ruby solutions to advent of code 2019 (adventofcode.com).
+ `lib` contains each individual day solution.
+ `data` is a required folder with files like `day04.txt`, but is not included here.

## Usage

+ Run `ruby scripts/setup_day.rb 07 4` to create files for day 7 with 4 test examples.
+ Run `ruby scripts/solve_day.rb 07` to print solutions for day 7.

## Development
